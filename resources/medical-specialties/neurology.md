# Neurology :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Neurology is the specialty within the medical field pertaining to nerves and the nervous system. Neurologists diagnose and treat diseases of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, muscles, autonomic nervous system, and blood vessels. Much of neurology is consultative, as neurologists treat patients suffering from strokes, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, seizure disorders, and spinal cord disorders.

Neurology offers several subspecialties, including the following:

* Brain injury medicine
* Child neurology
* Clinical neurophysiology
* Endovascular surgical neuroradiology
* Hospice and palliative medicine
* Neurodevelopmental disabilities
* Neuromuscular medicine
* Pain medicine
* Sleep medicine
* Vascular neurology
