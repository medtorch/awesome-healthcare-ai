# Pathology & Laboratory Medicine :heavy_exclamation_mark:
A physician specializing in pathology studies the causes and nature of diseases. Through microscopic examination and clinical lab tests, pathologists work to diagnose, monitor, and treat diseases. They examine tissues, cells, and body fluids, applying biological, chemical, and physical sciences within the laboratory. They may examine tissues to determine whether an organ transplant is needed, or they may examine the blood of a pregnant woman to ensure the health of the fetus.

Pathology umbrellas several areas of subspecialty within the field, including the following:

* Anatomical pathology
* Blood banking and transfusion medicine
* Chemical pathology
* Clinical pathology
* Cytopathology
* Forensic pathology
* Genetic pathology
* Hematology
* Immunopathology
* Medical microbiology
* Molecular pathology
* Neuropathology
* Pediatric pathology
