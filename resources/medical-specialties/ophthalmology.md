# Ophthalmology :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Physicians specializing in ophthalmology develop comprehensive medical and surgical care of the eyes. Ophthalmologists diagnose and treat vision problems. They may treat strabismus, diabetic retinopathy, or perform surgeries on cataracts or corneal transplantation.

There are several subspecialties within the ophthalmology field, including the following:

* Anterior segment/cornea ophthalmology
* Glaucoma ophthalmology
* Neuro-ophthalmology
* Ocular oncology
* Oculoplastics/orbit
* Ophthalmic Plastic & Reconstructive Surgery
* Retina/uveitis
* Strabismus/pediatric ophthalmology
