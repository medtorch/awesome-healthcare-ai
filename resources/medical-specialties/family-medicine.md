# Family Medicine & Community Health :heavy_exclamation_mark:
While many medical specialties focus on a certain function of the body or particular organ, family medicine focuses on integrated care and treating the patient as a whole. Physicians who specialize in family medicine treat patients of all ages. They are extensively trained to provide comprehensive health care and treat most ailments.

There are family medicine subspecialties as well, including the following:

* Adolescent medicine
* Geriatric medicine
* Hospice and palliative medicine
* Pain medicine
* Sleep medicine
* Sports medicine
