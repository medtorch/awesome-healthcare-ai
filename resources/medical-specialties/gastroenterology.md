# Gastroenterology & Hepatology :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Gastroenterology is the branch of medicine focused on the digestive system and its disorders. Diseases affecting the gastrointestinal tract, which include the organs from mouth into anus, along the alimentary canal, are the focus of this speciality. 

Hepatology, or hepatobiliary medicine, encompasses the study of the liver, pancreas, and biliary tree, and is traditionally considered a sub-specialty of gastroenterology, while proctology encompasses disorders of the anus, rectum, and colon and is considered a sub-specialty of general surgery.

### Datasets
- [Liver Disorders Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Liver+Disorders) - Data on 345 patients with and without liver disease. Features are 5 blood biomarkers thought to be involved with liver disease.
- [The Kvasir Dataset](https://datasets.simula.no/kvasir/) - The Kvasir Dataset consists of 8,000 images in 8 classes showing anatomical landmarks, phatological findings or endoscopic procedures in the GI tract, i.e., 1,000 images for each class. The classes are the same as in the Kvasir v1: Z-line, pylorus, cecum, esophagitis, polyps, ulcerative colitis, dyed and lifted polyps and dyed resection margins.
