# Preventative Medicine & Nutrition :heavy_exclamation_mark:
Physicians specializing in preventative medicine work to prevent disease by promoting patient health and well-being. Their expertise goes far beyond preventative practices in clinical medicine, covering elements of biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental and occupational medicine, and even the evaluation and management of health services and healthcare organizations. The field combines interdisciplinary elements of medical, social, economic, and behavioral sciences to understand the causes of disease and injury in population groups.

Subspecialties within preventative medicine include the following:

* Aerospace medicine
* Medical toxicology
* Occupational medicine
* Public health medicine
