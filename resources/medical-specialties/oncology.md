### Datasets
- [Isic Archive - Melanoma](https://github.com/GalAvineri/ISIC-Archive-Downloader) This archive contains 23k images of classified skin lesions. It contains both malignant and benign examples. Each example contains the image of the lesion, meta data regarding the lesion (including clasisfication and segmentation) and meta data regarding the patient.
- [Lung Image Database Consortium ](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/LIDC-IDRI#) - The intent of the Lung Imaging Database Consortium (LIDC) initiative was to support a consortium of institutions to develop consensus guidelines for a spiral CT lung image resource and to construct a database of spiral CT lung images.

- [CT Colongraphy for Colon Cancer](https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/CT+COLONOGRAPHY#dc149b9170f54aa29e88f1119e25ba3e) CT scan for diagnosing of colon cancer. Includes data for patients without polyps, 6-9mm polyps, and greater than 10 mm polyps.
- [TCIA Collections](http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) - Cancer imaging data sets across various cancer types (e.g. carcinoma, lung cancer, myeloma) and various imaging modalities. The image data in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) is organized into purpose-built collections of subjects. The subjects typically have a cancer type and/or anatomical site (lung, brain, etc.) in common.
