# Radiology :heavy_exclamation_mark:

:bookmark: Physicians specializing in diagnostic radiology are trained to diagnose illnesses in patients through the use of x-rays, radioactive substances, sound waves in ultrasounds, or the body’s natural magnetism in magnetic resonance images (MRIs).

They can also pursue a subspecialty in the following areas:

* Abdominal radiology
* Breast imaging
* Cardiothoracic radiology
* Cardiovascular radiology
* Chest radiology
* Emergency radiology
* Endovascular surgical neuroradiology
* Gastrointestinal radiology
* Genitourinary radiology
* Head and neck radiology
* Interventional radiology
* Musculoskeletal radiology
* Neuroradiology
* Nuclear radiology
* Pediatric radiology
* Radiation oncology
* Vascular and interventional radiology

### Open-source
- [OpenREM](https://bitbucket.org/openrem/openrem/src/develop/) - OpenREM is a free, open source application for patient radiation dose monitoring. The software is capable of importing and displaying data from a wide variety of x-ray dose related sources with filtering, charts and analysis. The software also enables easy export of the data in a form that is suitable for further analysis by suitably qualified medical physics personnel.
