# Surgery :heavy_exclamation_mark:

Physicians specializing in surgery can choose to become general surgeons or pursue a subspecialty in a specific area of the body, type of patient, or type of surgery. General surgeons provide a wide variety of life-saving surgeries, such as appendectomies and splenectomies. They receive broad training on human anatomy, physiology, intensive care, and wound healing.

* Colon and rectal surgery
* General surgery
* Gynecologic oncology
* Plastic surgery
* Neurological surgery

* Pediatric surgery
* Surgical Intensivists, specializing in critical care patients
